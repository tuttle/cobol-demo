These little COBOL programs demonstrate some simple programming tasks.

OpenCOBOL for Linux can be used to compile to ELF executable like this:

    $ cobc -free -x -o seq_read seq_read.cbl

There is also a neat IDE called Open COBOL IDE written in Python 3 available
as a package python3-opencobolide.

Have fun.
